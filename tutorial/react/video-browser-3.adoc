== VideoList

The ultimate goal of the `VideoList` component is to display a list of one or more `VideoListItem`, based on search results produced by `App` and `SearchBar`.

This component will not need to hold any state, so we can make it a plain _functional component_.

=== Functional components

[NOTE]
_Class based components_ versus _functional components_: Up until now we have used _class based components_. These types of components can, as you have seen, hold local state. A React _functional component_ is literally a plain javascript function, which can take zero or more object arguments and returns a React element.

The `VideoList` will get videos from search result and should then create visual elements based on that content. It will not need any local states for achieving this.

[quote]
____
. In `video-list.js`, create a const `VideoList` and assign it a plain function returning an empty `<ul>` element
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';

const VideoList = function () {
    return (
        <ul className="col-md-4 list-group">

        </ul>
    );
};
----
+
This can also be written using the condensed fat arrow syntax:
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';

const VideoList = () => {
    return (
        <ul className="col-md-4 list-group">

        </ul>
    );
};
----
+
. Make sure to export the component so we can import it in other components
+
[source,javascript]
----
export default VideoList;
----
+
. Also note that we did sneak in some styling in `<ul className="col-md-4 list-group">`. For convenience we will make use of some ready made CSS from Bootstrap. In order to this to work we must link to it, so in `my-app/public/index.html` please add the following `<link>` element:
+
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/twbs/bootstrap/48938155eb24b4ccdde09426066869504c6dab3c/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">

</head>
<body>

Ok, the `VideoList` component is now in place, returning an empty `<ul>` element. We will add more content to this element soon, but first we should head back to `app.js` and use the `VideoList` component there. 

The current content of `app.js` should now look like this:

[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import SearchBar from './components/search-bar';
import YTSearch from 'youtube-api-search';

const API_KEY = "<the-key>";

class App extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = { videos: [] };

        YTSearch({key: API_KEY, term: 'acorntechnology'}, (videos) => {
            this.setState({ videos: videos });
        });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <SearchBar/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
----

The only thing displayed on page right now is the `<SearchBar/>` element. Let's add the `<VideoList/>` element as well. 

[quote]
____
. In `app.js`, add import to `VideoList`
+
[source,javascript]
----
import VideoList from "./components/video-list";
----
+
. Place `<VideoList/>` below `<SearchBar/>`
+
[source,javascript]
----
render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <SearchBar/>
            <VideoList/>
        </div>
    );
}
----
____

Not much happens in the browser yet. We need to perform some additional steps to get a search result list rendered.

=== Passing props

We are in a situation where the `<App/>` component's state holds the videos search result. To be able to show the results in `VideoList`, we must pass it down somehow. React supports this in a quite straight forward fashion, by allowing us to add properties to JSX tags. This is usually referred to as _passing props_.

[quote]
____
. In `app.js`, add `videos` property to the `VideoList` JSX tag, pass `this.state.videos` as props.
+
[source,javascript]
----
render() {
    return (
        <div>
            <SearchBar/>
            <VideoList videos={this.state.videos}/>
        </div>
    );
}
----
+
. In `video-list.js`, add argument `props` to the function. This will be the recieving end of the props passing. Also add a temporary printout of the `props` content inside the `<ul>` element.
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';

const VideoList = (props) => {
    return (
        <ul className="col-md-4 list-group">
            {props.videos.length}
        </ul>
    );
};

export default VideoList;
----
+
Take peek at the browser, you should see the length of search result array directly below the search bar.
____

== VideoListItem

So now `VideoList` has an array of videos in it, which we can iterate over to produce individual `VideoListItem` elements. This can be achieved using traditional for loops, but that is kind of bulky. We will instead loop over the array elements using the built-in Map iterator.

=== About Map iterator

The easiest way to explain the Map iterator is perhaps by using the browser developer's tools javascript console for a demo. Use the console and enter the following:

. `var array = [1,2,3];`

. `array.map(function(number){ return number * 2 });`
+
Note the resulting output
+
. `array.map((number) => { return number * 2 });`
+
The same but using condensed arrow function instead
+
. `array.map((number) => { return '<div>' + number + '</div>' });`
+
The last example demonstrates roughly what we want to do with our videos array, iterate over it and create elements for each item.

But first we need to setup `video-list-item.js` properly.

[quote]

        <li>Video</li>
    );

    return (
        <VideoListItem video={video}/>
    )

+
[source,javascript]
----
return (
    <ul className="col-md-4 list-group">
        {videoItems}
    </ul>
);
----
+
The complete `video-list.js` should look like this:
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React from 'react';
import VideoListItem from './video-list-item';

const VideoList = (props) => {

    const videoItems = props.videos.map(video => {
        return (
            <VideoListItem
                onVideoSelect={props.onVideoSelect}
                key={video.etag}
                video={video}/>
        );
    });

    return (
        <ul className="col-md-4 list-group">
            {videoItems}
        </ul>
    );
};

export default VideoList;
----

=== Lists and keys

[IMPORTANT]
====
We know have a warning in the console. It is telling us that
React want us to provide a unique key for each element in our video list. Keys will help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. 

In order to optimize and be able to update individual items, you should always provide a unique key for every item. (React can render changes to lists anyway, but must then rerender the whole list and not only the individual item).

Also see link:https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys[React doc about keys in lists]
====

Keys in list should be unique for each item. Regarding our videos, we can use the `etag` of each video present in the youtube response.

image:key-etag.png[]

[quote]
____
. In `video-list.js`, Add property `key={video.etag}` to `VideoListItem` JSX tag
+
[source,javascript]
----
<VideoListItem key={video.etag} video={video}/>
----
____

Now it's high time to work on making the list item a bit more informative, making it display information for each video instead of just the hardcoded "Video".

First let's take look at how the video object actually looks like by printing it to console.

[quote]
____
. In `video-list-item.js` add `console.log(props.video);` as the first line in the function and then check the developer's tools Console tab
+
You should see a list with one item per found video. Expand one and take a look at the property `snippet`. Here you'll find a `title` and also some image urls under `thumbnails` that will be good to use. 

. Remove the console.log statement when done.
____

Let's start by adding a bunch of markup and other things to better display the video information. Please note that we will use some styling classes from bootstrap, so we do not need to think about css that much here.

[quote]
____
. In `video-list-item.js`, add a const holding the videos from the props argument

        <li>Video</li>
    );

                <div className="media-left">
                    <img className="media-object" alt="" />
                </div>
                <div className="media-body">
                    <div className="media-heading"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </li>
    );
};
----
+
. Create a const `imageUrl` holding the video's image URL
+
[source, javascript]
----
const imageUrl = video.snippet.thumbnails.default.url;
----
+
. Add property `src` to `img` tag, referencing `imageUrl`
+
[source, javascript]
----
<img className="media-object" alt="" src={imageUrl} />
----
+
Things are starting to happen, take look at the browser!
+
. Add the title of the video into `div` with className `media-heading`
+
[source, javascript]
----
<div className="media-heading">{video.snippet.title}</div>
----
____

[TIP]
Note that the videos shown in list are from the default searchTerm "acorntechnology", defined in `app.js`. You can of course change this to anything you like.

We have a list showing search result which is great! There is still some things we need to do, like we want users to be able to select which video to watch, for starters. We will address these matter in a while, but for now we put the `VideoList` and `VideoListItem` to rest.

Instead it's time to work on making the video detail section a tad more usable.

== VideoDetail

The `VideoDetail` component is responsible for presenting the content of an actual video. Sounds great, so let's create it.
    
[NOTE]
====
Before we go a head, here is a question you should ask yourself before creating components: _"Do I expect this component to maintain any type of state?"_

* If yes - create a _class based component_

* If no - you can probably get by with creating a _functional component_

====

Regarding the `VideoDetail` component, we will get all data feeded through the `props` argument, and there is no real need for holding any state since we just want to display the stuff we get through `props`. This suggest that it is enough to create a functional component here.

[quote]
____

    return (
        <div className="video-detail col-md-8">
            <div className="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                <iframe className="embed-responsive-item"></iframe>

                <div></div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};
----
____

First we want to display the title and description of the video. This information will be present in the `props` object coming in from `<App>` (although we haven't written that code yet).

The `props` object will contain one single `video` from search.

[quote]
____

[source,javascript]
----

    const video = props.video;

    ...
};

The video object we recieved from YouTube contains a lot of information. We are interested of the _title_ and _description_, both available under _snippet_:
+
image:YTSearch-video-snippet.png[]
+
. Add title and description to the two empty <div> tags under `<div className="details">`

            <div className="details">
                <div className="video-title">{video.snippet.title}</div>
                <div>{video.snippet.description}</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};
----
____

In order to embed the video in the iframe tag we just created, we need to construct a url to YouTube containing the id of the video we want to display. 

The full url is `https://www.youtube.com/embed/<the-videoId>`, where we must replace _<the-videoId>_ with an actual id.

This id can be pulled from `video.id.videoId`:

                <SearchBar/>
                <VideoDetail />
                <VideoList videos={this.state.videos}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You will see an error in the javascript console, "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"

Can you deduct why this happens?

====
____

We must also submit a `video` for the `VideoDetail` to show (that is why we get the console error right now, `VideoDetail` tries to work with `props.video`, but we don't pass anything yet, so it is undefined). 

We haven't come to the implementation of the actual selection of videos yet, so for now let us just hardcode the first video in array so we have something to look at.

[quote]
____
. In `app.js`, add the first video in array to `<VideoDetail />` as props
+
[source,javascript]
----
...
import VideoDetail from "./components/video-detail";
...

class App extends React.Component {
    ...
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <SearchBar/>
                <VideoDetail video={this.state.videos[0]}/>
                <VideoList videos={this.state.videos}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When saving we still get the error message in the console log: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined". Seems like the first video object we are sending is 'undefined', so it fails when we try to lookup the id. Why is that?

The explanation lies within how React works during rendering. Please keep calm and read on.

====
____

=== React rendering behavior

In the constructor of the `App` component, the `this.state` object is initialized with the property `videos` holding an empty array. Next in the constructor the function `YTSearch` is called for searching videos and `this.state.videos` is updated with the result. This search can take some time (albeit usually a very short time), during which the `this.state.videos` contains an empty array.

React works in the way that it will render the complete component while the `YTSearch` function completes. This means that `VideoDetail` will render using the empty array, ending up trying to access the id of an "undefined" object. When `YTSearch` finally is complete and the state is updated, React will re-render everything, this time with content in the videos array.

We must hence make our code a little more robust so it takes care of possible situations where `videos` can be undefined or null.

[quote]
____
. In `video-detail.js`, add a null check returning a div with the message _"Loading..."_

[source,javascript]
----
const VideoDetail = (props) => {

    if (!props.video) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>
    }    

    const video = props.video;
    const videoUrl = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/" + video.id.videoId;
    ...
};
----
This should get rid of the problem and the video should be displayed and it should be possible to play it.
____

Next up we want to get rid of the hard coded first video and prepare for passing along a deliberately selected video to the `VideoDetail` component. 

This is preferrably added to the state object of `app.js`, this component will then hold state containing the videos from search result together with the current user selected video. 

[quote]
____
. In `app.js`, add `selectedVideo` as a property to the state object
+
[source,javascript]
----
    this.state = {
        videos: [],
        selectedVideo: null
    };
----
+
Then make sure to pass the property along.
+
. In `app.js`, change the video property of `VideoDetail` to use `this.state.selectedVideo` instead
+
[source,javascript]
----
<VideoDetail video={this.state.selectedVideo}/>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
A look at browser shows us that we are stuck in the _"Loading..."_ mode, which makes kind of sense since we aren't yet updating the `selectedVideo` state. 

In the constructor the `YTSearch` function searches for videos and currently it updates `this.state.videos` with all videos. At the same time, we want it to update `this.state.selectedVideo` with the first video in the result array.

====
+
. In `app.js`, update the state and set `selectedVideo` to the first video
+
[source,javascript]
----
YTSearch({key: API_KEY, term: 'acorntechnology'}, (videos) => {
    this.setState({
        videos: videos,
        selectedVideo: videos[0]
    });
});
----
____

Since the state is changed, React will re-render `<App/>` and all it's children. `VideoDetail` will re-render with the new video.

=== Callbacks

Let's continue with adding code that allows the user to select a video from the list and play it. 

This means that we must implement a _callback_ that will be passed from `App` via `VideoList` down to `VideoListItem`, which responsibility will be to handle selections from the list (i.e. when user selects a video in the list). When a selection is made, `App` will become aware of it through the _callback_ and the `App` state property `selectedVideo` will be updated.

[...] which will result in React re-rendering everything again so the selected video becomes visible in `VideoDetail`.

[TIP]
====
If you did find the last passage a bit hard to follow, don't fret. It will probably become a bit clearer when we do the coding in the upcoming steps.

====

Let's start coding.

[quote]
____
. In `app.js`, add a new property to tag `VideoList` called `onVideoSelect`. This property should be a function that updates the `selectedVideo` state
+
[source,javascript]
----
<VideoList
    onVideoSelect={selectedVideo => this.setState({selectedVideo})}
    videos={this.state.videos}/>
----
+
Since we now are passing `onVideoSelect` as a property to `VideoList`, we need to add code in `video-list.js` to mirror this. We need to continue to pass the callback down to `VideoListItem`.
+
. In `video-list.js`, add new property `onVideoSelect` to tag `VideoListItem`, passing on the callback in `props.onVideoSelect`
+
[source,javascript]
----
const videoItems = props.videos.map(video => {
    return (
        <VideoListItem
            onVideoSelect={props.onVideoSelect}
            key={video.etag}
            video={video}/>
    );
});
----
+
So now we are passing the props `onVideoSelect` down to `VideoListItem`. Next up is to add code in `video-list-item.js` that handles that property. Let's use this so whenever a user clicks on an `<li>` element, that particular video should be sent back via the callback.
+
. In `video-list-item.js`, add another const that holds the callback in `props.onVideoSelect`
+
[source,javascript]
----
const onVideoSelect = props.onVideoSelect;
----
+
. To the `<li>` element's `onClick` event, add a function that calls `onVideoSelect` with the `video` variable
+
[source,javascript]
----
<li onClick={() => onVideoSelect(video)} className="list-group-item">
----
+
This will result in whenever a user clicks on that element, the callback will be called with the video for that element.
____

[NOTE]
And on that bomb shell it should now be possible to select and view videos in the browser by clicking the items!

Very fine indeed, good job! But since this is hairy stuff that maybe doesn't feel all natural, let's run through what actually happens one more time.

* `App` defines a callback function that takes a video and updates the `selectedVideo` on `state`, it then passes this function as the property `onVideoSelect` to `VideoList` component. 

* `VideoList` takes the given property and passes it on to `VideoListItem`. 

* `VideoListItem` takes the property and says _"whenever I get clicked, call that function with my video"_. Since each `VideoListItem` has a different video, each particular video will be sent as argument into the callback function on click.

* When the callback is made, the `selectedVideo` state in `App` gets updated, triggering React to rerender the component, which now will display the selected video in `VideoDetail`. 

[NOTE]
====
This example shows how a parent component can communicate with it's child components. It is however usually not wise to create callback jumps like these in more than *two levels of depth*. It quickly becomes confusing to follow callback chains where you must hunt around in different files to find the actual source function. 

There are more suitable ways to share complex states between components, if necessary, for example _Redux_, which we will be looking at in the third session.

====

We can now see all components on the page in browser. It is time to add code for handling search terms entered in the search bar and send that of to YouTube.
