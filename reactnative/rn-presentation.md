React & React Native
"Learn Once, Write Anywhere"

<!-- slide -->
### What is React-Native?

* Javascript engine for Mobile with direct hooks to native components supported on the mobile platform.
* iOS, Android, ~~Windows Phone~~
* A React-Native App has ~~no~~ limitation~~s~~, as its support for native libraries means if you are lacking native support, you can implement it yourself.  <span style="font-size: 0.5em;">This is a lie - it is not suitable for anything with dynamic animations based on user feedback, like games, **yet**...</span>

#### Motto
~~Write Once, Run Anywhere~~
Learn Once, Write Anywhere

<!-- slide -->
### Where does it come from?

- Developed by Facebook
- Dogfooded by Facebook for Facebook app, Messenger, etc.
- Released open-source by Facebook to the world on one condition:
  - *You may not sue Facebook for patent infringement*
- Used by Facebook, WIX, Instagram, Uber, Discord, Bloomberg, Discovery VR, ...

### How does it work I ?

<!-- slide -->
### How does it work II ?
<img src ="images/rn_architecture.png" height="500"></img>
- Runtime Environment: Javascript Core
- Most React-Native controls interact with a native counterpart
  - Pure-javascript components are obviously also supported and inherently cross-platform (but with a performance penalty, and they won't "look" native)
- React Native provides the bridge between JS and native
  - Events passed through the bridge between JS and native
- Native code runs in its own thread, so it won't block the UI thread.
  - Animations, scrolling, maps, sound, video, etc, run with "native" performance with native look.

<!-- slide -->
### How does it work III ?
<img src ="images/rn_architecture.png" height="500"></img>
- Pure Android/iOS application is compiled from source and deployed to phone. This application includes all necessary native components, including native Java/Kotlin/Obj-C/Swift/C++ libraries needed by the javascript.
- Node web server runs which holds all of the React-Native JavaScript code.
- In Debug mode, the JavaScript code bundled and transferred from the development PC to the phone via USB/WIFI/Ethernet/etc...
  - This enables **live reload** and **hot reload** on changes to the JavaScript UX.
- In Release mode, the JavaScript code is bundled as a blob included in the release app.

<!-- slide -->
### Why use React-Native (Pros)
- Rapid development
- Learn once, write anywhere
- "Normal" apps are not limited by the provided RN API
  - Huge community of 3rd party modules
  - Roll your own native modules
- Lean UX development (hot reloading speeds UX development)
- Share pure javascript code between server and client
- One development team needed with Javascript competence, rather than separate Android/iOS teams
- Use native views, buttons, lists, video-players, camera app, gallery app, maps, etc.
- Distribute javascript code independently of app ("Expo").

<!-- slide -->
### React Native vs Expo
#### React Native
- A React Native project is created using react-native init <project_name>
- React Native project generates native Android and XCode projects in your new project directory which can be compiled from raw source code.
- Projects can be compiled in XCode/Android Studio, you can modify the React Native library code, you can add libraries, etc.
- You may need to know more about React Native than you really want to.
- Extra functionality is added with package managers via "yarn add <module>" or "npm install <module>"

#### Expo
- An Expo project is created using create-react-native-app <project_name>
- An Expo project runs in the Expo App, a prebuilt app which can be downloaded from Google Play or iOS App Store.
- The Expo App is a pre-built react-native app including many native modules not included in default react-native template project.
  - camera, push notifications, vector icons, etc...
- Expo's own build servers can be used to generate Android and iOS apps for release on Google Play or the iOS App Store.
- Must do "expo eject" if you want to modify any native libraries or add native code.
  - generates the android/ and xcode/ libraries including the open source expo app source code.

<!-- slide -->
### Example App 1

Create a first app and open the generated folder in Atom.

```sh
react-native init tutorial_1
```

Copy and paste this code over your App.js code for a basic example of how to use a native ListView component on both Android and iOS.

```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Text, View, ListView} from 'react-native';

export default class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});
    let numbers = [...Array(100)];
    numbers.map((value, index, array)=>{array[index] = index.toString();})
    this.state = {
      dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows( numbers )
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text style={{height: 50}}></Text>
        <ListView
          dataSource={this.state.dataSource}
          renderRow={(rowData:string, unused:string, index:string) =>
              <Text>  Row {index} = {rowData}</Text>}
        >
        </ListView>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

<!-- slide -->
### Reload the app to see changes

You need to reload the app to see any changes:

#### IOS or Android Device:
Reload the app: Shake your phone, select "Reload"
#### IOS Simulator reload:
Click on the simulator and press CMD+R
#### Android Simulator reload:
From shell, type "adb shell input keyevent 82"
Then click on "Reload"

<!-- slide -->
#### Breakdown of the first app, part 1/2

- Import what is needed from react and react native.
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Text, View, ListView} from 'react-native';
```
- Export the App Component by default to any Components which import this file.

```javascript
export default class App extends Component {  
```
- Create a constructor that creates a ListView datasource with 100 elements in it.
```javascript
  constructor() {
    super()
    const ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});
    let numbers = [...Array(100)];
    numbers.map((value, index, array)=>{array[index] = index.toString();})
    this.state = {
      dataSource: ds.cloneWithRows( numbers )
    };
  }
```

<!-- slide -->
#### Breakdown of the first app, part 2/2
```javascript
  render() {
    // return JSX which defines the screen based on current state and props.
    return (
      <View>
        <Text style={{height: 50}}></Text>
        <ListView
          dataSource={this.state.dataSource}
          renderRow={(rowData:string, unused:string, index:string) =>
              <Text>  Row {index} = {rowData}</Text>}
        >
        </ListView>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
- The render() function returns the jsx which defines the screen.
- The list view component's props expect a function (renderRow) which knows how to display each row. We define this here too.

<!-- slide -->
### Live Reload and Hot Reload

#### Live Reload

- Watches your project file system for changes
- Automatically reloads the javascript bundle from scratch any time you save a file.  
- Useful if you are changing app logic that can effect global app state, where Hot Reload would fail.
- If you are tweaking a screen's layout, may require re-navigating to that screen on every change.

#### Hot Reload

- Watches your project file system for changes
- Updates the current screen without reloading the whole app
- Useful if you are only changing rendering components such as layouts, fonts, images, icons, colours, sizes, etc, that don't affect global app state.
- Sometimes, the app will fail on a hot reload as a new state variable is added or removed
  - Full app reload will restore the state.

<!-- slide -->
### Let's enable Live Reload

- Enable live reloading
  - Open the debug menu:
    - Shake the Phone (CMD+D or "adb shell input keyevent 82")
    - Select "Enable Live Reload"
    - ![live reload](images/debug_menu.png)
- Now any time you make a change to the app and save it, your app will reload automagically.

<!-- slide -->
### Example App 2 - Contact List Code 1/2
- We'll now create a fake contact list app, with a button to add a new random contact.
- Paste this over the top of your App.js, above the component declaration.

```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Text, View, Button, ListView, Image} from 'react-native';
const first_names = ["Thomas", "Magnus", "Gustav", "Emi", "Emma", "Remya",
"Chris", "Ken", "Carl", "David", "JÃ¶rgen", "Johanna", "Anna", "Marie",
"Peter", "Jan", "Jenny", "Helene"];
const last_names = ["A.","B.","C.","D.","E.","F.","G.","H.","I.","J.","K.",
"L.","M.","N.","O.","P.","Q.","R.","S.","T.","U.","V.","W.","X.","Y.","Z."];

function getRandom(max){
  return Math.floor((Math.random() * max));
}
function getName(){
  let rnd = getRandom(first_names.length);
  let name:string = first_names[rnd];
  rnd = getRandom(last_names.length);
  name += " " + last_names[rnd];
  return name;
}
function getPic(){
  let url = "https://picsum.photos/50/50/?image=";
  url += getRandom(200).toString();
  return url;
}
function getNumber(){
  let number = "070";
  for (let i = 0; i < 7;i++){
    number += getRandom(10).toString();
  }
  return number;
}
```

<!-- slide -->
### Example App 2 - Contact List Code 2/2
Replace the inside of your App component with the following code.
```javascript
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.ds = new ListView.DataSource({rowHasChanged: (r1, r2) => r1 !== r2});
    this.state = { contacts:[], ds:[] };
    this.state = this.addOneContact(true);
  }
  addOneContact(isConstructor){
    let contact = {name:getName(), number:getNumber(), pic:getPic()};
    let contacts = [...this.state.contacts, contact];
    let ds = this.ds.cloneWithRows(contacts);
    let newState = {contacts:contacts, ds:ds};
    if (!isConstructor){
      this.setState(newState); // can't call setState from constructor.
    }
    return newState;
  }
  renderRow(rowData, unused, index){
    return (
      <View style={{backgroundColor:'#E0FFFF'}}>
        <Image style={{width: 50, height: 50}} source={{uri: rowData.pic}} />
        <Text>{rowData.name}, {rowData.number}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
  render() { return (
      <View style={{flex:1, alignItems: 'stretch'}}>
        <ListView style={{flex:1, marginTop:20}} dataSource={this.state.ds}
          renderRow={(rowData, unused, index) => {
            return this.renderRow(rowData, unused, index);}} />
        <Button title="Add One"
          onPress={()=>{this.addOneContact()}} style={{alignSelf:'center'}} />
      </View>);
  }
```

### It works, but it's ugly
![ugly](images/contacts_ugly.png)

Let's fix it up using [Flexbox](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox)

<!-- slide -->
### Flexbox

<img src="images/flex-box_img.png" />

- [Facebook's page on Flexbox](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox) lets you play around with doing app layout with flexbox.

- Flexbox lets you specify app screen layout loosely as ratios of screen or component size in your jsx code, and react-native will take care of stretching, shrinking,  centering, aligning, and wrapping, etc., components for you.

- Flexbox in combination with hot-reload makes rapid UI design possible.

- Here is a [flexbox cheatsheat pdf](http://jonibologna.com/content/images/flexboxsheet.pdf).

- Here is a [one page cheat sheet](https://gapintelligence.com/blog/2017/the-flexbox-one-page-cheat-sheet)

<!-- slide -->
### Let's use styles and flexbox. ###

- Disable Live Reload
- Enable Hot Reload
- Click "Add One" Button a few times to ensure you have something useful in your app state.
- Replace renderRow() with the following code.
```javascript
renderRow(rowData, unused, index){
  return (
    <View style={{backgroundColor:'#E0FFFF', margin:1, flexDirection:'row', alignItems:'center'}}>
      <Image style={{margin:1, width: 51, height: 51}}
        source={{uri: rowData.pic}} />
      <Text style={{flex:1, marginLeft:10}}>{rowData.name}</Text>
      <Text style={{flex:1}}>{rowData.number}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
Play around with the definitions to see if you can make it prettier.

<!-- slide -->
### Let's call someone.

- We can make the each item into a clickable button by replacing the containing View with a Touchable*
- There are different sorts of touchables, which act as views but have different animation types when clicked.
- We can use TouchableOpacity
- Import TouchableOpacity and Alert

```javascript
import {Text, View, Button, ListView, Image, TouchableOpacity, Alert} from 'react-native';
```

<!-- slide -->
#### Add an alert, and print output to console.
```javascript
renderRow(rowData, unused, index){
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity style={{backgroundColor:'#E0FFFF', margin:1,
      flexDirection:'row', alignItems:'center'}}
      onPress={()=>{
        Alert.alert(
          'Calling ' + rowData.name,
          'Are you sure?',
          [
            {text: 'Cancel', onPress: () => console.log('Call Canceled')},
            {text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('Called ' + rowData.name)},
          ],
        )
      }}
      >
      <Image style={{margin:1, width: 51, height: 51}}
        source={{uri: rowData.pic}} />
      <Text style={{flex:1, marginLeft:10}}>{rowData.name}</Text>
      <Text style={{flex:1}}>{rowData.number}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
}
```
This results in a platform-native alert window with two buttons.
![alert](images/calling_alert.png)

<!-- slide -->
#### Where's the debug console? 1/3

If we want to debug the javascript, or see the console, we can use Chrome as a debugger....

- Shake the phone (CMD+R or "adb shell keyinput 82")
- Select "Debug JS Remotely"
- Chrome should open a new tab
![debug 1](images/debug_console_1.png)

<!-- slide -->
#### Where's the debug console? 2/3

Select "..."-->"More Tools"-->Developer Tools
![debug 2](images/debug_console_2.png)

<!-- slide -->
#### Where's the debug console? 3/3
![debug 3](images/debug_console_3.png)

- You can add your folder to the workspace to click through and edit code directly from chrome. (Be sure to allow chrome access in the pop up which will appear!)
- You can set breakpoints from within chrome.
- Now make a call, and you will see the call printed in the console.

<!-- slide -->
### Flow 1/5
- Flow-type is similar to Microsoft TypeScript
- Supported by atom/nuclide if you followed the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md)
- Supports static error and type checking of all flow-enabled source code
- Enabled by adding @flow at the top of the document
- Let's "flow-ize" the app so we can catch errors when writing code instead of crashing suddenly while running code.

<!-- slide -->
### Flow 2/5
- Add @flow to the top of **App.js**
```javascript
/** @flow */
```
- If flow is running correctly, you should start seeing squiggly lines in the code.
- Define parameter types and return types on all functions at the top of the file. (just copy and paste from here)
```javascript
function getRandom(max:number):number{
  return Math.floor((Math.random() * max));
}
function getName():string{
  let rnd = getRandom(first_names.length);
  let name:string = first_names[rnd];
  rnd = getRandom(last_names.length);
  name += " " + last_names[rnd];
  return name;
}
function getPic():string{
  let url = "https://picsum.photos/50/50/?image=";
  url += getRandom(200).toString();
  return url;
}
function getNumber():string{
  let number = "070";
  for (let i = 0; i < 7;i++){
    number += getRandom(10).toString();
  }
  return number;
}
```

<!-- slide -->
### Flow 3/5
- Define the types used by the App Component

```javascript
// Flow type declarations
type Contact = {name: string, number:string, pic:string}; // Contact object
type Props = {}; // Expect no incoming props
type State = { contacts: Array<Contact>, ds:any}; // Component state
```

- Use Props and State in Component Declaration
```javascript
// Class declaration including the component types.
export default class App extends Component<Props, State> {
  ds:any;
  state:State = { contacts:[], ds:[] };
```

<!-- slide -->
### Flow 4/5
- Update types passed into the addOneContact() and renderRow() components
```javascript
  addOneContact(isConstructor:?boolean):State{
    let contact:Contact = {name:getName(), number:getNumber(), pic:getPic()};
    let contacts = [...this.state.contacts, contact];
    let ds = this.ds.cloneWithRows(contacts);
    let newState:newState = {contacts:contacts, ds:ds};
    if (!isConstructor){
      this.setState(newState);
    }
    return newState;
  }
  renderRow(rowData:Contact, unused:string, index:string){
    return (
      <TouchableOpacity style={{backgroundColor:'#E0FFFF', margin:1,
        flexDirection:'row', alignItems:'center'}}
        onPress={()=>{
          Alert.alert(
            'Calling ' + rowData.name,
            'Are you sure?',
            [
              {text: 'Cancel', onPress: () => console.log('Call Canceled')},
              {text: 'OK', onPress: () => console.log('Called ' + rowData.name)},
            ],
          )
        }}
        >
        <Image style={{margin:1, width: 51, height: 51}}
          source={{uri: rowData.pic}} />
        <Text style={{flex:1, marginLeft:10}}>{rowData.name}</Text>
        <Text style={{flex:1}}>{rowData.number}</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    );
  }
```

<!-- slide -->

### Flow 5/5
- Make some mistakes in the code and see what happens in the IDE
![flow error](images/flow_error_catch.png)
- Flow also allows for auto-complete in javascript code.  Type the object name for a known type, and Atom with Nuclide will provide appropriate autocomplete selections.

### React-Native Cons
- Developing in Windows is less than ideal
  - Slow build time
  - Can only build for Android
  - Path length limitations in Windows OS
- **Dependencies must be continually updated**
  - Android Dependencies
    - Android Studio, Android Build Tools, Gradle, Java, Kotlin, Gradle, Gradle, Gradle
  - XCode Dependencies
    - Swift language, Swift libraries, Swift deprecation
  - RN Dependencies.
    - Need latest RN to support latest XCode to support latest iPhone, but latest RN breaks native module camera, GPS, and maps.
    - Need latest RN to support latest Android Studio, but that breaks native module soundplayer, imageshrinker, and cow pusher.
  - Workaround 1: Most 3rd party modules are published on github, so you can wait until the author publishes a fix, or fix it yourself and be a hero.
  - Workaround 2: Wait before upgrading your build tools/XCode/Android Studio
  - Workaround 3: Lock all native module versions and javascript in your package.lock.
  - Workaround 4: Use **Expo**
